Validate this pension guidance principle against FCA guidelines.

Principle: "{{ principle }}"

Check:
1. Does it stay within the guidance boundary (not crossing into regulated advice)?
2. Does it align with FCA consumer protection principles?
3. Is it specific and actionable?
4. Would following it improve customer outcomes?

If the principle suggests:
- Recommending specific products → INVALID (advice, not guidance)
- Making suitability assessments → INVALID (requires regulation)
- Generic good practices → LOW CONFIDENCE (too vague)

Format your response as:
Valid: [True/False]
Confidence: [0.0-1.0]
Reason: [brief explanation]
