A rule is valuable if it:
1. Addresses a specific, non-obvious situation
2. Provides concrete, actionable guidance
3. Goes beyond common sense
4. Could prevent real customer harm or confusion

A rule is NOT valuable if it:
1. States obvious common sense ("be polite", "be clear")

3. Doesn't add to existing FCA guidance

Format your response as:
