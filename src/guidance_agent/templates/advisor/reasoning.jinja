Before providing guidance, think through the situation step-by-step.

CUSTOMER PROFILE:
{{ customer | customer_profile }}

CUSTOMER'S QUESTION:
"{{ customer.presenting_question }}"

RETRIEVED CONTEXT:
Similar Cases:
{{ context.cases | cases }}

Learned Rules:
{{ context.rules | rules }}

FCA REQUIREMENTS:
{{ context.fca_requirements if context.fca_requirements else "Stay within guidance boundary" }}

TASK:
Think through this step-by-step:

**Situation Analysis:**
1. What is the customer really asking?
2. What are the key considerations for this situation?
3. What similar cases or rules are relevant?
4. What risks or important points must be covered?
5. How should I adapt my language for their literacy level?
6. What checks should I include to ensure understanding?

**Conversational Strategy Analysis:**
7. **Conversation Phase**: Is this an opening (greeting, rapport-building), middle (information exchange, exploration), or closing (summarization, next steps)?
8. **Customer Emotional State**: Are they anxious/overwhelmed (use reassurance, break down complexity), confident/engaged (match energy, provide deeper detail), confused (simplify, check understanding frequently), or frustrated (acknowledge, validate, offer clear path forward)?
9. **Tone & Pacing**: How should I match their communication style? What information density is appropriate for their literacy level? Where should I use shorter sentences? Where do I need conversational breathing room (questions, summaries)?
10. **Signposting & Transitions**: What signposting phrase is most appropriate for this response? How do I transition smoothly from the previous message? How do I set up the next interaction naturally?
11. **Personalization Opportunities**: Where should I use the customer's name? Which specific details should I reference? How can I connect to their unique goals?
