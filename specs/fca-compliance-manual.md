---

<a name="section-4"></a>
## 4. COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION PROCESS

### 4.1 The Five-Step Evaluation Method

**STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE CORE STATEMENT**

Extract the main message from the customer support response.

**Example:**
Response: "Looking at your situation, I think the Growth ISA would work really well for you given your timeline."

Core Statement: "Growth ISA would work well for you given your timeline"

---

**STEP 2: APPLY THE FOUR-PART TEST**

Test 1: **Is this to someone in their capacity as an investor?**
- Question: Is the customer seeking to invest or manage investments?
- If YES → Continue to Test 2
- If NO → Not regulated advice

Test 2: **Is this about a particular investment product?**
- Question: Does it mention a specific investment by name or type?
- If YES → Continue to Test 3
- If NO → May be generic advice (check Tier 2 criteria)

Test 3: **Is it presented as suitable OR based on customer's circumstances?**
- Question A: Does it say or imply the product is suitable/right/appropriate for them?
- Question B: Does it reference their personal situation/goals/timeline/age/etc.?
- If YES to either → Continue to Test 4
- If NO to both → Likely not a personal recommendation (recheck Tests 1&2)

Test 4: **Is it NOT exclusively to the public?**
- Question: Is this directed at this specific customer (not a public communication)?
- If YES (it's personal) → **PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION = BREACH**
- If NO (it's public) → Not a personal recommendation

---

**STEP 3: CHECK FOR RED FLAG LANGUAGE**

Review the statement against all Category A-F prohibited language:
- ☐ Category A: Direct Recommendations
- ☐ Category B: Suitability Language  
- ☐ Category C: Comparative Value Judgments
- ☐ Category D: Personal Circumstance References
- ☐ Category E: Implicit Steering
- ☐ Category F: Persuasive Language

**Scoring:**
- 0 flags = Review for implicit issues
- 1-2 flags = Likely breach
- 3+ flags = Definite breach

---

**STEP 4: EVALUATE TONE AND CONTEXT**

Consider how a reasonable customer would interpret the communication:

**Questions to Ask:**
1. Would a reasonable customer think they're receiving personalized advice?
2. Is there an implication that the staff member is recommending this?
3. Does the tone suggest expertise/authority in investment selection?
4. Is the customer being steered toward a decision?
5. Are benefits emphasized without equivalent risk disclosure?

**Context Factors:**
- Medium (phone, email, chat - phone is highest risk)
- Relationship (new vs. established customer)
- Customer's level of sophistication
- Nature of the query
- Customer's expectations

---

**STEP 5: DETERMINE COMPLIANCE STATUS**

**COMPLIANT** if:
- Pure factual information (Tier 1), OR
- Generic advice not linked to specific products (Tier 2), AND
- No personal recommendation elements, AND
- No prohibited language, AND
- Neutral tone and presentation

**NON-COMPLIANT** if:
- Meets all four tests for personal recommendation, OR
- Contains 2+ Category A-F red flags, OR
- Reasonable customer would view it as personalized advice, OR
- Steering toward specific products based on circumstances

**ESCALATE** if:
- Borderline case with 1 red flag
- Ambiguous tone/context
- Novel scenario not covered in training
- Customer pushed back on disclaimer

## 6. SCENARIO-BASED DECISION MAKING

### 6.1 Customer Query Types and Correct Responses

#### SCENARIO TYPE 1: Product Information Requests

**Customer:** "Tell me about your ISAs"

❌ **NON-COMPLIANT:**
"Our Growth ISA is excellent - it's perfect for younger investors looking for long-term growth. Most customers in their 30s choose this one."

**Problems:** Value judgment ("excellent"), suitability claim ("perfect for younger investors"), personal recommendation ("customers in their 30s")

✅ **COMPLIANT:**
"We offer three ISA products: Cash ISA, Stocks & Shares ISA, and Lifetime ISA. Each has different features, charges, and investment approaches. I can provide you with the key features documents for each, or you can speak with an adviser who can recommend which might suit your circumstances."

**Why It's Compliant:** Factual list, neutral presentation, signposts to adviser for recommendations

---

#### SCENARIO TYPE 2: "What Should I Choose?" Requests

**Customer:** "I'm 45 and want to save for retirement. What should I invest in?"

❌ **NON-COMPLIANT:**
"At your age, I'd suggest a balanced fund. It gives you growth potential while managing risk as you're 20 years from retirement. Fund X is our best balanced option."

**Problems:** Directive advice ("I'd suggest"), personalized to age, recommended specific fund, value judgment ("best")

✅ **COMPLIANT:**
"I can't provide investment recommendations, but I can explain what products we offer. We have pension products with various investment strategies. To get a recommendation on what would suit your specific circumstances, I'd recommend speaking with one of our authorized financial advisers. They can consider your retirement goals, current situation, and create a suitable plan. Would you like me to arrange a call with an adviser?"

**Why It's Compliant:** Clear disclaimer, factual information, appropriate signposting, no recommendation

---

#### SCENARIO TYPE 3: Existing Product Concerns

**Customer:** "My fund has been losing money. Should I switch?"

❌ **NON-COMPLIANT:**
"Fund performance has been down, so yes, you might want to consider moving to Fund Y which has been performing better."

**Problems:** Recommendation to switch, comparative judgment ("performing better"), specific alternative suggested

❌ **ALSO NON-COMPLIANT:**
"Market fluctuations are normal. You should stay invested for the long term."

**Problems:** Advice to maintain position, influencing investment decision

✅ **COMPLIANT:**
"I can see your fund value has decreased. Investment values can go up and down. I can provide you with the current performance information and fund fact sheet. Whether to stay invested, switch funds, or take other action is an investment decision. I'd recommend speaking with an adviser who can review your circumstances and provide personalized advice. Would you like me to arrange an adviser call?"

**Why It's Compliant:** Acknowledges concern, provides facts, doesn't recommend action, signposts appropriately

---

#### SCENARIO TYPE 4: Comparison Requests

**Customer:** "Which is better - your Premium or Standard account?"

❌ **NON-COMPLIANT:**
"The Premium account is better value if you have over £50k. Most customers with your investment level choose Premium."

**Problems:** Value judgment ("better value"), personalization ("customers with your investment level"), recommendation ("choose Premium")

✅ **COMPLIANT:**
"I can explain the differences between the accounts. The Standard account costs £X annually and includes features A, B, C. The Premium account costs £Y annually and includes features D, E, F, plus additional services. The choice depends on which features are important to you and your circumstances. An adviser can help you determine which better matches your needs. Here are the comparison documents."

**Why It's Compliant:** Factual comparison, neutral presentation, signposts for personalized assessment

---

#### SCENARIO TYPE 5: Risk Tolerance Questions

**Customer:** "I don't want to lose money. What should I invest in?"

❌ **NON-COMPLIANT:**
"You sound risk-averse, so I'd recommend our Low Risk fund or just keeping it in cash."

**Problems:** Risk assessment, direct recommendation, specific products suggested

✅ **COMPLIANT:**
"Different investments carry different levels of risk. All investments except cash deposit accounts carry some risk of loss. Lower risk options tend to have lower potential returns. Higher risk options have higher potential returns but also higher potential losses. Understanding your risk tolerance and how much risk you're comfortable with is really important. An adviser is trained to assess your risk appetite and recommend appropriate investments. I'd strongly suggest speaking with an adviser before making any investment decision."

**Why It's Compliant:** General risk education, no specific recommendation, clear adviser signpost

---

#### SCENARIO TYPE 6: Time Horizon Queries

**Customer:** "I need this money in 5 years for a house deposit. What do you recommend?"

❌ **NON-COMPLIANT:**
"For a 5-year timeline, you'd want something moderate risk. Fund X is designed for mid-term goals like yours."

**Problems:** Personalized recommendation, specific fund suggested, claiming suitability ("like yours")

✅ **COMPLIANT:**
"The timeframe you have is certainly an important factor in investment decisions. We have products with different risk levels and investment approaches. Some are designed for shorter-term goals, some for longer-term. With a specific timeframe and goal like a house deposit, an adviser would consider several factors including your risk tolerance, how essential this timeline is, and what happens if the value falls short. They can then recommend appropriate options. Would you like to speak with an adviser about this?"

**Why It's Compliant:** Acknowledges factor's importance, doesn't make recommendation, explains adviser value

---

#### SCENARIO TYPE 7: Product Feature Explanation

**Customer:** "How does your pension drawdown product work?"

✅ **COMPLIANT:**
"Our pension drawdown product allows you to keep your pension invested while taking income from it. Here are the key features:

- Minimum pension pot size: £X
- You can take up to X% as income
- Investment options: [list]
- Charges: £Y annually plus Z% investment fee
- Tax treatment: [factual explanation]
- Flexibility: [describe rules]

The product documentation explains everything in detail. Whether drawdown is suitable for you depends on your circumstances, other income sources, tax position, and retirement plans. An adviser can assess if it's right for you and help you set an appropriate withdrawal rate."

**Why It's Compliant:** Comprehensive factual information, clear on adviser need for suitability

---

#### SCENARIO TYPE 8: Fee/Charge Queries

**Customer:** "Your fees seem high. Should I switch to a cheaper provider?"

❌ **NON-COMPLIANT:**
"Our fees are competitive for the service level. You get what you pay for, and switching might not save you much."

**Problems:** Value judgment ("competitive"), steering against switching, implied recommendation

✅ **COMPLIANT:**
"Our charges are [state clearly]. When comparing providers, it's important to consider not just charges but also service levels, investment performance, product features, and any exit fees or switching costs. Whether switching would be beneficial depends on your specific situation and the other provider's offering. An adviser can help you do a full comparison if you're considering switching."

**Why It's Compliant:** Factual about charges, general factors to consider, signposts for decision support

"Thank you for considering investing with us. With investment decisions, especially significant amounts like £50,000, it's important to get personalized advice.

I cannot provide investment recommendations as I'm not an authorized adviser. An adviser would consider various factors including:
- Your investment goals and timeframe
- Your attitude to risk
- Your current financial situation
- Any existing investments or savings
- Your tax position
- What the money is for

Our advisers can then recommend specific investment products and strategies suitable for you. We offer both face-to-face and telephone advisory services. Would you like me to arrange an appointment with an adviser? There's typically a charge for advice which the adviser would explain."

**Analysis:** Clear disclaimer, explains adviser value without steering, offers appropriate service.

---

**B2: Product Choice Assistance**

**Customer:** "Should I choose the ISA or the pension?"

**✅ COMPLIANT RESPONSE:**
"Both ISAs and pensions have different benefits and restrictions, and the right choice depends entirely on your personal circumstances.

**Key Factual Differences:**

**ISAs:**
- Tax-free growth and withdrawals
- Can access money anytime
- No tax relief on contributions
- Annual subscription limit: £20,000
- Can inherit tax-free

**Pensions:**
- Tax-free growth
- Tax relief on contributions (effective 25% boost for basic rate taxpayers)
- Cannot normally access before age 55 (rising to 57)
- Annual allowance: £60,000 (with some exceptions)
- 25% tax-free lump sum on retirement

The choice between them depends on factors like:
- When you need access to the money
- Your current tax position
- Your retirement planning
- Other savings you have

An adviser can assess your situation and recommend the best approach for you. Would you like to speak with an adviser about this?"

**Analysis:** Comprehensive factual comparison, multiple relevant factors, clear adviser signpost.

#### Example Set C: Dealing with Circumstantial Information

**C1: Age-Based Inquiry**

**Customer:** "I'm 55. What investments are suitable for someone my age?"

**✅ COMPLIANT RESPONSE:**
"Age is certainly one factor that financial advisers consider when making recommendations, but it's just one of many factors. Suitable investments vary significantly between individuals of the same age based on:

- Investment goals (retirement income, legacy planning, specific purchases)
- Risk tolerance
- Investment time horizon
- Existing assets and pensions
- Income needs
- Tax position
- Attitude to investment volatility

We have customers of all ages using our full range of products from high-risk growth funds to low-risk income funds. What's suitable is very individual.

I'd recommend speaking with an adviser who can complete a full assessment of your circumstances and goals to recommend appropriate investments. Would you like me to arrange an adviser consultation?"

**Analysis:** Doesn't make age-based assumptions, explains assessment complexity, clear signposting.

---

**C2: Risk Profile Discussion**

**Customer:** "I'm fairly cautious with money. What would you suggest?"

**✅ COMPLIANT RESPONSE:**
"Understanding your attitude to risk is an important part of investment decisions. Financial advisers use detailed risk profiling questionnaires to accurately assess your risk tolerance - it's more complex than just 'cautious' or 'adventurous'.

They consider factors like:
- How you'd react to investment losses of various sizes
- Your experience with investments
- Your capacity for loss given your financial situation
- The purpose of this money
- Your time horizon

Even investors who consider themselves cautious might have different parts of their portfolio at different risk levels depending on goals and timelines.

All our products have risk ratings from their Key Investor Information Documents, ranging from 1 (lowest risk) to 7 (highest risk). An adviser can determine appropriate risk levels for you and recommend suitable products.

Would you like to speak with an adviser about risk profiling and investment selection?"

**Analysis:** Educates on risk assessment complexity, avoids making assumptions, signposts appropriately.

---

#### Example Set D: Handling Product Performance Questions

**D1: Poor Performance Query**

**Customer:** "My fund is down 15% this year. Is it a bad fund? Should I switch?"

**✅ COMPLIANT RESPONSE:**
"I can see your fund value has decreased by 15% year-to-date. Let me provide you with some factual information:

**Your Fund Performance:**
- YTD: -15%
- 1 year: [state figure]
- 3 year: [state figure]
- 5 year: [state figure]

**Benchmark Comparison:**
- Your fund tracks the [index name] index
- This index is: [state performance]
- Your fund performance relative to benchmark: [state]

**Context:**
- This fund is categorized as [risk level]
- Investment values can fluctuate
- Past performance isn't indicative of future performance

Whether to stay invested or switch is an investment decision that depends on:
- Your investment goals and timeframe
- Whether your circumstances have changed
- Your overall portfolio
- Alternative options
- Any exit charges or switching costs

I'd strongly recommend speaking with an adviser before making any decision about switching investments. They can review your full situation and provide personalized recommendations. Would you like me to arrange an adviser call?"

**Analysis:** Factual performance data, context without judgment, doesn't advise action, appropriate signposting.

---

**D2: Strong Performance Query**

**Customer:** "Fund X has done really well. Should I invest more in it?"

**✅ COMPLIANT RESPONSE:**
"Fund X has indeed had strong recent performance:
- YTD: [state]
- 1 year: [state]
- 3 year: [state]

It's important to remember:
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future returns
- Strong recent performance can sometimes indicate higher current valuation
- Fund X is categorized as [risk level]
- Diversification across different assets is generally considered important

Whether to invest more in any specific fund, or whether that fund remains suitable for you, depends on your overall investment strategy, risk tolerance, and goals.

An adviser can review your full portfolio, assess if Fund X remains appropriate for you, and advise on appropriate diversification. I'd recommend speaking with an adviser before making additional investments.

Would you like to arrange an adviser consultation?"

**Analysis:** Provides facts, includes important caveats, doesn't endorse the decision, signposts to adviser.

---

#### Example Set E: Fee and Charge Discussions

**E1: Fee Comparison**

**Customer:** "I saw another provider charging 0.35% and you charge 0.75%. Why should I stay with you?"

**✅ COMPLIANT RESPONSE:**
"Our platform charge is 0.75% annually, which includes:
- Investment administration
- Account management
- Online access and reporting
- Customer support
- [list all included services]

When comparing providers, factors to consider include:
- Total costs (platform + fund charges + trading costs + any other fees)
- Service levels included
- Investment options available
- Ease of use
- Additional features
- Any exit fees here or entry fees elsewhere

I can provide you with our full charging schedule so you can make a comprehensive comparison.

Whether switching would be beneficial overall depends on your specific usage, needs, and the complete cost/service comparison. An adviser can help you assess whether switching would be in your best interest when considering all factors.

I cannot advise you whether to stay or go - that decision is yours. But I'm happy to provide any information about our services that would help your decision."

**Analysis:** Transparent about charges, factors for consideration without steering, neutral on decision.

---

#### Example Set F: Complex Situation Handling

**F1: Pension Transfer Inquiry**

**Customer:** "I want to transfer my old company pension here. What should I do?"

**✅ COMPLIANT RESPONSE:**
"Pension transfers, particularly from defined benefit (final salary) schemes, are important decisions that require careful consideration and often professional advice.

**Process Steps:**
1. Determine what type of pension you have
2. Request transfer value from your current provider
3. Check for any guarantees, protections, or benefits you'd give up
4. Consider if transfer aligns with your retirement goals
5. Assess charges for transferring and holding with new provider

**Important Information:**
- If your pension is a defined benefit scheme worth over £30,000, you're legally required to get advice from an FCA-authorized adviser before transferring
- Even for other pension types, financial advice is strongly recommended
- Transfers can take 6-8 weeks to complete
- You may give up valuable guarantees or benefits

I can provide you with our pension transfer fact sheet and charges information. For a recommendation on whether transferring would be in your best interest, you would need to speak with a pensions transfer specialist adviser.

Would you like me to arrange a consultation with one of our specialist pension transfer advisers? Please note there is a charge for this advice, which the adviser would explain."

**Analysis:** Explains process without recommending transfer, highlights advice requirement, appropriate specialist referral.

### 7.2 Non-Compliant Response Examples (with Corrections)

Each example shows a non-compliant response, explains why it's wrong, and provides the compliant alternative.

#### Example Set G: Common Violations

**G1: Direct Recommendation**

**Customer:** "What's your view on Fund X?"

**❌ NON-COMPLIANT:**
"Fund X is an excellent choice. It's been our top performer and I'd definitely recommend it for long-term growth."

**Why It's Non-Compliant:**
- Value judgment ("excellent choice")
- Comparative claim ("top performer")
- Direct recommendation ("I'd definitely recommend")
- Suggests suitability ("for long-term growth")

**✅ COMPLIANT VERSION:**
"Fund X is one of our equity funds focused on [investment strategy]. Here are the key facts:

- Risk rating: [state]
- Charges: [state]
- Past performance: [state factually]
- Investment objective: [state from documents]

I can provide you with the fund fact sheet and KIID. Whether Fund X is suitable for you depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. An adviser can assess if it's appropriate for your circumstances."

---

**G2: Personalized Suitability Claims**

**Customer:** "I want to retire in 10 years. What fund should I be in?"

**❌ NON-COMPLIANT:**
"With a 10-year timeline, you'd want our Balanced Growth Fund. It's designed for people in your position - it gives you growth potential while gradually reducing risk as you approach retirement."

**Why It's Non-Compliant:**
- Specific fund recommendation
- Personalized to timeline ("in your position")
- Suitability claim ("designed for people in your position")
- Investment recommendation without authorization

**✅ COMPLIANT VERSION:**
"A 10-year timeline to retirement is certainly relevant information for investment planning. This involves considerations like:

- Your current asset allocation
- Your risk tolerance and capacity for loss
- Other sources of retirement income
- How much you need at retirement
- Whether you want pre-retirement de-risking
- Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies

These are complex decisions that an authorized financial adviser is trained to assess. They can consider your full circumstances and create a suitable investment strategy for your retirement goals.

I'd strongly recommend speaking with an adviser about retirement planning. Would you like me to arrange a consultation?"

---

**G3: Implicit Steering Through Emphasis**

**Customer:** "Tell me about your fund range"

**❌ NON-COMPLIANT:**
"We have 15 funds. While they're all good, our Global Growth Fund has been especially popular and has really stood out with fantastic performance. We also have some other funds too."

**Why It's Non-Compliant:**
- Highlighting one fund over others
- Enthusiasm marker ("especially", "really", "fantastic")
- Popularity claim linked to performance
- Implicit recommendation through emphasis
- Dismissive of other options ("some other funds too")

**✅ COMPLIANT VERSION:**
"We offer 15 funds across different asset classes and risk levels:

[Provide structured, equal-weight list of all funds with basic facts]

Each fund has different objectives, strategies, and risk profiles. I can send you information on all of them, or if you'd like to narrow down based on factual criteria like asset class or risk rating, I can help with that.

For recommendations on which funds are suitable for you, an adviser can assess your circumstances and goals."

---

**G4: Comparison Using Value Judgments**

**Customer:** "What's the difference between your Premium and Standard accounts?"

**❌ NON-COMPLIANT:**
"The Premium account is better value if you have over £25k. You get more features and better service. Most investors upgrade to Premium once they reach that level."

**Why It's Non-Compliant:**
- Value judgment ("better value")
- Comparative quality claim ("better service")
- Implicit recommendation ("most investors upgrade")
- Personalizes without assessment ("if you have over £25k")

**✅ COMPLIANT VERSION:**
"Here's a factual comparison:

**Standard Account:**
- Annual charge: 0.5%
- Minimum charge: £25/year
- Maximum charge: £250/year
- Included: Online access, quarterly statements, phone support
- Fund options: All 15 funds

**Premium Account:**
- Annual charge: 0.3%
- Minimum charge: £75/year
- Maximum charge: No maximum
- Included: Everything in Standard, plus: dedicated adviser access, monthly statements, priority phone support, face-to-face reviews
- Fund options: All 15 funds plus 30 additional funds

The break-even point (where Premium becomes lower cost) is approximately £25,000 invested. However, the right choice also depends on which features you value and would use.

An adviser can help you assess which account type suits your needs and investment level."

---

**G5: Risk Assessment Without Authorization**

**Customer:** "How much risk should I take?"

**❌ NON-COMPLIANT:**
"At your age and with your timeframe, you can afford to take more risk. I'd suggest looking at higher-risk funds for better returns."

**Why It's Non-Compliant:**
- Risk assessment based on customer circumstances
- Direct recommendation ("I'd suggest")
- Specific guidance on risk level
- Implicit suitability judgment
- Unauthorized risk profiling

**✅ COMPLIANT VERSION:**
"Determining appropriate risk levels is a key part of investment planning that requires a full assessment of your circumstances.

Advisers use detailed risk profiling processes that consider:
- Your emotional reaction to losses of various sizes
- Your financial capacity to absorb losses
- Your investment time horizon
- Your investment goals
- Your experience with investments
- Your current financial situation

They then match you to appropriate risk-rated investments.

This isn't something I can assess - it requires an authorized adviser's professional evaluation. I'd recommend speaking with an adviser who can complete a proper risk profile and recommend suitable investment risk levels for you."

## 8. EDGE CASES AND GREY AREAS

### 8.1 Borderline Scenarios Requiring Judgment

#### EDGE CASE 1: Following Up on Customer's Own Decision

**Scenario:** Customer says "I've decided to invest in Fund X." How should staff respond?

**❌ REINFORCING - NON-COMPLIANT:**
"Great choice! Fund X is excellent and should work well for you."

**Why It's Wrong:** Validates the decision as suitable, implies recommendation

**❌ QUESTIONING - NON-COMPLIANT:**
"Are you sure? Have you considered Fund Y which might be better?"

**Why It's Wrong:** Questions decision, suggests alternative, implies suitability judgment

**✅ NEUTRAL ACCEPTANCE - COMPLIANT:**
"I can process that investment for you. Before I do, I need to make sure you've received and understood the Key Investor Information Document for Fund X. Have you reviewed this? [If no, provide]. Do you have any questions about the fund's objectives, risks, or charges?"

**Why It's Compliant:** Processes request, ensures appropriate disclosure, doesn't validate or question suitability

**✅ APPROPRIATE WARNING - COMPLIANT (if relevant):**
"I can process that. I should mention that Fund X is rated as high risk (6 out of 7). Make sure you're comfortable with the possibility of significant losses as well as gains. Have you considered speaking with an adviser to ensure it's suitable for your circumstances?"

**Why It's Compliant:** Factual risk statement, appropriate warning, signposts to adviser without steering

---

#### EDGE CASE 2: Customer Misunderstanding Corrections

**Scenario:** Customer states a factual error about a product. Should staff correct it?

**Customer Says:** "So this pension means I can access all my money tax-free at 55, right?"

**❌ MINIMAL CORRECTION - NON-COMPLIANT:**
"Not quite - you should speak to an adviser about the tax rules."

**Why It's Wrong:** Doesn't correct dangerous misunderstanding, insufficient to prevent unsuitable decision

**✅ FULL FACTUAL CORRECTION - COMPLIANT:**
"Let me clarify the tax rules as there's a common misunderstanding here:

- You can access pensions from age 55 (rising to 57 in 2028)
- 25% of the pension value can be taken tax-free
- The remaining 75% is taxed as income at your marginal rate
- So on a £100,000 pension: £25,000 tax-free, £75,000 taxable

The tax treatment is complex and depends on your other income. An adviser can help you understand the tax implications and plan tax-efficient withdrawals.

It's important you understand these rules before deciding to access your pension. Would you like to speak with an adviser about pension access?"

**Why It's Compliant:** Corrects factual error clearly, provides essential facts, signposts for personalized advice

---

#### EDGE CASE 3: Responding to External Advice

**Scenario:** Customer mentions they received advice from an external source (friend, family, internet) and asks for confirmation.

**Customer Says:** "My friend said I should put everything in your Global fund because it's the best. Is he right?"

**❌ VALIDATING - NON-COMPLIANT:**
"Your friend knows what he's talking about - the Global fund is indeed our best performer."

**Why It's Wrong:** Validates external advice, makes suitability judgment, comparative claim

**❌ DISMISSING - NON-COMPLIANT:**
"Your friend isn't qualified to give advice - you should ignore that."

**Why It's Wrong:** While technically correct about advice authorization, dismissive tone inappropriate

**✅ APPROPRIATE RESPONSE - COMPLIANT:**
"I can give you factual information about our Global fund [provide details], but I can't comment on whether it's suitable for you specifically - that requires a personal assessment of your circumstances.

What works for your friend may not be right for you because:
- Different financial situations
- Different risk tolerances
- Different goals and timelines
- Different tax positions

I'd recommend speaking with one of our authorized advisers who can assess your specific circumstances and provide personalized recommendations. Friends mean well, but authorized advisers have professional training, regulatory obligations, and can be held accountable for their advice.

Would you like me to arrange an adviser consultation?"

**Why It's Compliant:** Doesn't dismiss friend rudely, explains risk of non-personalized advice, signposts appropriately

---

#### EDGE CASE 4: Urgent Time-Sensitive Situations

**Scenario:** Customer wants to make urgent investment decision (e.g., end of tax year).

**Customer Says:** "It's the end of the tax year tomorrow. I need to use my ISA allowance. What should I invest in quickly?"

**❌ RUSHED RECOMMENDATION - NON-COMPLIANT:**
"Just put it in the Balanced fund for now - it's our most popular middle-ground option."

**Why It's Wrong:** Recommendation under time pressure, suitability claim, urgency doesn't permit unsuitable advice

**✅ APPROPRIATE URGENCY RESPONSE - COMPLIANT:**
"I understand you want to use your ISA allowance before the tax year ends tomorrow. You have options:

**Option 1: Cash ISA**
- No investment risk
- Current rate: [state]
- Money safe while you decide on investment strategy
- Can transfer to Stocks & Shares ISA later if you wish

**Option 2: Stocks & Shares ISA**
- Must choose investments today
- Given the tight timeline, I'd strongly recommend speaking with an adviser TODAY if possible
- We have advisers available [state availability]
- Quick advice call possible in many cases

**Option 3: Wait**
- New ISA allowance starts tomorrow
- More time to get proper advice
- No rush to make potentially unsuitable decision

The tax year deadline doesn't change the need for suitable investments. Rushed decisions can be costly. Which approach would you prefer, or would you like to speak with an adviser about your options?"

**Why It's Compliant:** Presents options objectively, highlights advice need, doesn't let urgency override suitability requirement

---

#### EDGE CASE 5: Vulnerable Customer Indicators

**Scenario:** Customer shows signs of vulnerability (confusion, pressure, anxiety about finances, health issues mentioned).

**Customer Says:** "I'm really confused about all this. My husband always dealt with finances and he passed away last month. I've got £200,000 and don't know what to do with it. What do you think I should do?"

**❌ QUICK SUGGESTION - NON-COMPLIANT:**
"I'm sorry for your loss. Just put it in a balanced fund for now - that's usually safe enough."

**Why It's Wrong:** Taking advantage of vulnerable state, recommendation without proper assessment, "safe enough" is unsuitable language

**✅ VULNERABLE CUSTOMER PROTOCOL - COMPLIANT:**
"First, I'm very sorry for your loss. This must be a difficult time.

Making important financial decisions during bereavement can be overwhelming, and there's often no need to rush. Here's what I'd suggest as next steps:

1. **Immediate Safety:**
   - If the money is currently in a savings account, it's safe there while you take time
   - If you're concerned about access, I can explain safe temporary options

2. **No Rush:**
   - Important investment decisions are best made when you're ready
   - Taking a few weeks or months to consider options is completely fine

3. **Professional Support:**
   - I'd strongly recommend speaking with a financial adviser
   - They can take time to understand your full situation
   - They can explain options in plain language
   - They can help you understand what your husband had set up
   - Would you like someone else to join the call (family member, friend)?

4. **Immediate Needs:**
   - Do you need access to any of this money for immediate expenses?
   - Are you comfortable with your current income?

I'm noting on your account that you've recently been bereaved so all our team can provide appropriate support. We have specialist advisers trained to help customers in your situation.

There's no pressure to make any decisions today. Would you like me to arrange a call with one of our specialist advisers, or would you prefer to think about it and call us when you're ready?"

**Why It's Compliant:** Identifies vulnerability, prioritizes customer welfare, no rush, appropriate specialist referral, documented support needs

---

### 8.2 Disclaimers and Their Limitations

#### Understanding Disclaimer Effectiveness

**Key Principle:** Disclaimers do NOT make unsuitable advice acceptable. They're helpful in borderline cases but cannot override clear breaches.

**Example 1: Ineffective Disclaimer**

❌ **STILL NON-COMPLIANT:**
"*This is not financial advice* - but given your age and goals, you should really invest in our Growth fund. It's perfect for your situation."

**Why Disclaimer Doesn't Help:**
- The substantive content is still a personal recommendation
- Disclaimer doesn't change what was communicated
- Customer still receives recommendation message

**Example 2: Effective Disclaimer Use**

✅ **COMPLIANT WITH DISCLAIMER:**
"*I cannot provide investment advice or recommendations.* I can explain our fund options and their features. For a recommendation on which is suitable for your circumstances, please speak with an authorized adviser. [Proceeds to give neutral, factual information]"

**Why This Works:**
- Sets clear expectation upfront
- Followed by actually neutral information
- Appropriate signposting

---

### 8.3 Group Communications vs Individual Communications

#### Distinguishing Public vs Personal Communications

**Key Test:** Is the communication issued to the public or to a specific individual based on their circumstances?

**Scenario 1: Email to All Customers**

**Sent to:** All customers holding Fund X  
**Content:** "Fund X is now closed to new investments. We've identified Fund Y as an alternative with a similar strategy."

**Analysis:**
- ❌ POTENTIAL BREACH if positioned as "you should move to Fund Y"
- ✅ LIKELY COMPLIANT if presented as "Fund X is closing; here are all similar alternatives including Fund Y"

**Critical Factor:** Are you recommending Fund Y specifically, or just informing about the situation?

**Scenario 2: Targeted Email Based on Characteristics**

**Sent to:** All customers aged 55-60  
**Content:** "As you approach retirement age, consider our Retirement Planning service and our Flexible Retirement Fund."

**Analysis:**
- ⚠️ HIGH RISK - Targeted based on circumstances (age)
- May constitute personal recommendations to a segment
- Age-based selection suggests personalization
- Suggesting specific fund could be implicit recommendation

**Better Approach:**
"As retirement approaches, investment needs often change. Our advisers specialize in retirement planning and can recommend suitable strategies. Book a free consultation."

---

### 8.4 Digital Interfaces: Websites, Apps, Chatbots

#### Special Considerations for Digital Channels

**Challenge:** Digital interfaces can inadvertently create personal recommendations through:
- Filtering based on user inputs
- Presenting "recommended for you" content
- Automated product suggestions
- Decision trees leading to specific products

**EDGE CASE 1: Risk Questionnaire Leading to Fund Suggestion**

**Scenario:** Website has risk questionnaire that outputs fund suggestions

**Example Flow:**
1. User answers questions about risk tolerance
2. System calculates risk profile: "You are Medium Risk"
3. System displays: "Based on your answers, these funds match your profile: [list]"

**Analysis:**
- ⚠️ LIKELY PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION if presented as "for you"
- Complex interplay of factors makes it appear personalized
- ✅ POTENTIALLY COMPLIANT if:
  - Very simple filtering (single factor like risk rating)
  - Clear messaging about limitations
  - Prominent advice encouragement
  - User clearly controls/understands filtering

**Safer Alternative:**
"Based on your selected risk preference of 'medium risk', here are funds rated 3-5 out of 7. This is a simple filter only - not personalized advice. Many other factors matter. Speak with an adviser for personal recommendations."

To be clear: [Staff Name] is not an authorized financial adviser and cannot provide personal recommendations on investments. While they can provide factual information about our products, recommendations on what's suitable for you should come from an authorized adviser.

[If YES, customer acted:]
We'd like to arrange for you to speak with one of our authorized advisers at no charge to review your situation and ensure any investments you've made remain suitable for you.

[If NO, no action:]
That's good. Going forward, if you need personalized recommendations, please request to speak with an authorized adviser. Is there anything about your current situation you'd like adviser help with?

We take compliance very seriously and have addressed this with our team to prevent similar issues. Do you have any questions or concerns?"

## APPENDIX A: QUICK REFERENCE CARDS

### CARD 1: The Five-Second Check

Before responding to ANY customer query:

1. ❓ Are they asking about investments? (If NO, proceed normally)
2. ❓ Am I about to recommend something? (If YES, STOP)
3. ❓ Am I about to say what's "suitable"? (If YES, STOP)
4. ❓ Am I using their circumstances? (If YES, STOP)
5. ❓ Can this be neutral + signpost? (If YES, do that)

**If any STOP → Provide facts only + signpost to adviser**

---

### CARD 2: Safe Response Templates

**When asked "What should I invest in?"**
"I can't provide investment recommendations as I'm not an authorized adviser. I can explain our product range, or arrange for you to speak with an adviser who can assess your circumstances and recommend suitable options."

**When asked "Is this suitable for me?"**
"Assessing suitability requires a full review of your circumstances, which is what our authorized advisers do. I can provide factual information about this product, but for a suitability assessment, I'd recommend speaking with an adviser."

**When customer makes a choice:**
"I can process that for you. Before I do, have you reviewed the Key Information Documents? Do you have any questions about the product features, risks, or charges?"

**When customer misunderstands:**
"Let me clarify that [provide factual correction]. It's important you understand [fact] before making a decision. Would you like to speak with an adviser who can explain how this applies to your situation?"

---

### CARD 3: Prohibited vs Permitted

**❌ NEVER SAY:**
- "I recommend..."
- "You should..."
- "This is best for you..."
- "Given your age/situation..."
- "People like you..."
- "This would work well..."
- "That's a good choice..."

**✅ ALWAYS SAFE:**
- "The features are..."
- "The options available are..."
- "I can explain..."
- "An adviser can recommend..."
- "Would you like to speak with an adviser?"
- "The fact sheet shows..."
- "I can process that..."

---

### CARD 4: Red Flag Checklist

Stop immediately if your response contains:

- [ ] Specific product recommendation
- [ ] Suitability judgment
- [ ] Reference to customer's circumstances
- [ ] Comparison using "better/best/worse"
- [ ] Validation of their choice as "good"
- [ ] Risk assessment of the customer
- [ ] "You should" statements
- [ ] "Perfect/ideal for you" phrasing

If any box checked → Reframe as neutral information + adviser signpost

## APPENDIX B: TRAINING SCENARIOS FOR PRACTICE

### Scenario 1: The Direct Question

**Customer:** "I'm 35 years old and want to save for retirement. What fund should I invest in?"

**Your Response:** ____________________________

**Model Answer:** 
"Retirement planning involves considering several factors specific to your circumstances. While I can explain our pension products and fund options, I cannot recommend specific investments as I'm not an authorized adviser.

We offer personal pensions with 15 investment fund choices across different risk levels and asset classes. Each has different objectives, charges, and risk profiles.

For a recommendation on which pension and which funds are suitable for your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance, I'd recommend speaking with one of our financial advisers. They can create a personalized retirement strategy for you.

Would you like me to:
1. Send you information on all our pension options and funds?
2. Arrange a call with an adviser? (typically a charge applies)
3. Both?

What would be most helpful for you?"

---

### Scenario 2: The Implicit Pressure

**Customer:** "Everyone at work is investing in your Emerging Markets fund. Should I do the same?"

**Your Response:** ____________________________

**Model Answer:** 
"I can provide information about our Emerging Markets fund, but what's suitable for your colleagues may not be suitable for you - everyone's circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance are different.

Here are the facts about the Emerging Markets fund:
- Risk rating: 6 out of 7 (high risk)
- Investment region: Developing economies in Asia, Latin America, Africa
- Volatility: Historically high volatility, large gains and losses possible
- Objective: Long-term capital growth
- Charges: [state]

This type of investment can be appropriate for some investors but isn't suitable for everyone. Whether it's right for you depends on your financial situation, time horizon, risk tolerance, and overall portfolio.

I'd strongly recommend speaking with an adviser before making this decision, especially if this would be a significant portion of your investments. They can assess if emerging markets exposure is appropriate for you and in what proportion.

Would you like me to arrange an adviser consultation?"

---

### Scenario 3: The Vulnerable Customer

**Customer:** (Sounds confused and anxious) "I don't understand all these investment terms. I just need to know - should I put my redundancy money in your Balanced fund or your Cautious fund? I can't afford to lose this money, but I need it to grow."

**Your Response:** ____________________________

**Model Answer:** 
"I can hear this feels overwhelming, and that's completely understandable - investment decisions can be complex, especially when the money is important to you.

First, there's no need to rush any decision. Your redundancy money can stay in a savings account while you take time to understand your options - that's completely fine.

I can explain the factual differences between our Balanced and Cautious funds, but I need to be clear: choosing between them requires assessing your full financial situation, which I'm not qualified to do. That assessment needs to come from an authorized financial adviser.

What I can tell you is:
- Both carry investment risk - you could lose money
- Cautious fund is lower risk but lower potential returns
- Balanced fund is moderate risk with moderate potential returns
- "Can't afford to lose" suggests need for very careful planning

Given what you've said about not being able to afford losses and needing growth, this sounds like a situation where professional advice would be really valuable. Our advisers can:
- Assess how much risk you can actually afford to take
- Explain options in plain language
- Create a plan that balances your need for safety and growth
- Suggest products suitable for your specific situation

This conversation with an adviser typically takes about an hour. Would you like me to arrange a call? Some people like to have a family member or friend join these conversations - that's completely fine too.

Would you prefer to:
1. Arrange an adviser call?
2. Take some time to think and call us back when you're ready?
3. Both - I'll arrange a call but for a date you choose?

There's no pressure to decide anything today. What feels right for you?"

---

### Scenario 4: The Comparison Question

**Customer:** "Your fees are 0.75% and I've seen another provider at 0.45%. Why would I pay more?"

**Your Response:** ____________________________

**Model Answer:** 
"That's a fair question about costs. Let me explain our fee structure and what you get for it.

Our platform charge is 0.75% which includes:
- Investment administration
- Regular reporting and online access
- Customer support (phone, email, chat)
- Research and fund information
- Consolidation of multiple investments
- [List all included services]

When comparing providers, there are several factors beyond the headline platform charge:
- Total costs (our fee + fund charges + trading costs)
- Service levels and support
- Range of investment options
- Quality of information and tools
- Any additional fees (admin fees, exit fees, etc.)

To make a fair comparison, you'd need to look at:
1. Total costs for your specific investments
2. Value of services you'd actually use
3. Any exit fees from here or entry fees there
4. Quality and availability of support

I can provide our full fee schedule and explain everything we charge. For understanding whether switching would save you money overall and whether the other provider's service level meets your needs, that's a detailed comparison that an adviser could help you work through.

Would you like me to send you our complete fee schedule, or would you like to discuss this with an adviser who can help you do a full comparison?"
